When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When working on a larger project or working with a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  So that you can update your local directory exactly when you want to. This way you have full control over changes to the local directory.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are basically GitHub clones that gives credit to orginal owner, allows contributor to publish commits without altering orignal master. Use this when making different versions for something that I don't want to start by scratch.

  Clones are exact copies of someone else's repository. When I want to do local work on a piece of work that has already been started.

  A branch is a separate direction of a particular repository. When I am working on the same project, but am visiting another potential outcome.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  To contrast differences between the local state and the online state

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  It would be very hard! We would have to email I guess!
